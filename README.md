# create-react-tsx-fc README

This is a really simple extension, which allows you to create a new Typescript file (.tsx) for a <NewComponent/>
with the name new_component.tsx (if it doesn't exist yet); 

just select the text 'NewComponent' within the tags, and execute the component.
ctrl+shift+p in VS-Code then: React FC from <Tag/>
